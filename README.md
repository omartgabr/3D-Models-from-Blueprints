# 3D Models from Blueprints


## Project Description
This project focuses on converting 2D multimodal blueprint images into 3D models using advanced image processing and computer vision techniques. By leveraging object detection, scale recognition, and edge detection, the project plans to extract key features from architectural, mechanical, plumbing, and structural floor plans. These features are then used to generate 3D models that provide enhanced visualization and a more intuitive understanding of complex floor plans.

## Problem statement (what)
Blueprints of building floor plans have been traditionally used by stakeholders but can be time-consuming and technical to read.
Challenges in manually analyzing blueprint images can lead to increased costs, errors, and misinterpretations.
Lack of effort to secure a large amount of data for deep learning

## Motivation (why)
- **3D Models** improve accessibility and visualization compared to traditional 2D floor plans.
- **Leverage Computer Vision (CV)** for faster, more accurate object detection and 3D conversion.
- **Broader Applications**: Potential use in virtual reality, real estate, and training simulations for emergency responders.
