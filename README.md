# 3D Models from Blueprints


## Project Description
This project focuses on the conversion of 2D architectural blueprints into accurate 3D models. Image processing and computer vision techniques will be used to generate object detection and node-edge detection algorithms of floor plan features. 

## Problem statement (what)
Blueprints of building floor plans have been traditionally used by stakeholders, but can be time-consuming and technical to read. These issues can lead to increased costs, errors, and misinterpretations.

## Motivation (why)
3D models aim to increase accessibility, visualization, and accuracy of full architectural layout. I will be leveraging computer vision techniques like object detection of floor plan features, as well as conversion from 2D to 3D models.
